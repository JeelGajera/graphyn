# PreToolUse on Edit/Write — say what the file about to change reaches.
#
# This hook never blocks. It answers a question the agent did not ask, and an
# unasked question is not grounds for refusing an edit. Its whole job is to put
# the blast radius in front of the model before the write, so a rename that
# breaks fourteen callers is visible at the moment it is decided rather than
# when CI fails.
#
# Input: Claude Code hook JSON on stdin, with tool_input.file_path.
# Output: exit 0, with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext when there is
# something worth saying. Silence when there is not — an agent's context window
# is not free.

# Locate the shared library.
#
# Guarded with a readability test rather than `. lib || fallback`: in POSIX sh,
# sourcing a file that does not exist is a special-builtin failure that
# terminates the shell on the spot, so the fallback never runs and the hook
# exits non-zero with no output. For a pre-commit hook that silently rejects
# every commit; for a Stop hook it traps the agent. Both were real.
