# PostToolUse on Edit/Write — report what the edit just broke.
#
# The edit has already happened, so this cannot and does not block. It reports
# broken references back as context, which is the earliest point an agent can
# act on them without a round trip through CI.
#
# It compares the working tree against the last commit rather than against the
# previous edit: an agent makes many small writes inside one change, and
# reporting each intermediate state would flag half-finished work as breakage.
#
# Requires a snapshot of HEAD. Without one it says nothing at all rather than
# analysing on the fly, because analysing here would make the answer depend on
# whatever else was in the tree at the moment the hook happened to run.

# Locate the shared library.
#
# Guarded with a readability test rather than `. lib || fallback`: in POSIX sh,
# sourcing a file that does not exist is a special-builtin failure that
# terminates the shell on the spot, so the fallback never runs and the hook
# exits non-zero with no output. For a pre-commit hook that silently rejects
# every commit; for a Stop hook it traps the agent. Both were real.
