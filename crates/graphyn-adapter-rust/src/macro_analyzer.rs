//! Derive macros as implementation edges.
//!
//! `#[derive(Serialize)]` generates a trait impl that never appears in the
//! source, so a purely syntactic pass misses it entirely. That matters for
//! impact analysis: changing a struct's fields changes its generated
//! `Serialize` output, and a caller reading that wire format depends on the
//! struct even though nothing in either file names the other.
//!
//! This module previously returned an empty vector while the README advertised
//! derive-macro support.
