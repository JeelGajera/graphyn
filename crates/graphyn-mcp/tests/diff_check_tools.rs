//! `graph_diff` and `check_rules` as an agent meets them.
//!
//! These tools return prose into a context window, and a model acts on the
//! sentences rather than inspecting the structure behind them. So the tests
//! are about the sentences: what the tool says when it has nothing, when it
//! could not look, and when it looked and found nothing are three different
//! answers, and only one of them is a pass.
//!
//! The failure being guarded against is a tool that says "no violations"
//! because no rule was evaluated. A person reading a terminal notices the
//! empty section; a model reading the summary does not.
