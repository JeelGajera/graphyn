//! MCP tool: graph_diff
//!
//! What changed between two recorded snapshots, and what it broke.
//!
//! A pure read over stored graphs. It never analyses: an agent asking "what
//! did my change break" must get an answer that depends on the two revisions
//! it named, not on whatever happened to be on disk when the tool ran.
//!
//! The output is prose rather than JSON because it is going into a context
//! window, where a model reads a sentence more reliably than it reads a nested
//! object — and where every token spent on punctuation is one not spent on the
//! finding.
