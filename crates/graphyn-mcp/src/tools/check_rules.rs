//! MCP tool: check_rules
//!
//! Evaluate `.graphyn/rules.toml` and report what the change breaks.
//!
//! The agent-facing half of `graphyn check`. It reports the same four verdicts
//! and takes the same care with them: a rule too weakly resolved to judge is
//! reported as undecided, a rule needing a change that was not supplied is
//! reported as skipped, and neither is presented as a pass.
//!
//! That care matters more here than at the command line. A person reading a
//! terminal notices a blank section; a model reading a summary that says
//! "no violations" will act on it. So this tool never emits that sentence
//! unless every rule was examined in full.
