//! What changed between two graphs.
//!
//! Every capability above this — broken-edge findings, rule evaluation, the
//! audit detectors — is a query over this delta, so its job is to describe the
//! change accurately and to say nothing it cannot support.
//!
//! # Why continuity is modelled rather than inferred
//!
//! A symbol's id embeds its file and its name, so renaming or moving one
//! produces a different id. Compared naively that reads as a delete plus an
//! add, and every consumer then reports a symbol destroyed and an unrelated
//! one created — the loudest possible description of the smallest possible
//! change. Worse, the later detectors would count a rename as contract
//! erosion.
//!
//! So a removed symbol and an added one are paired into a [`Continuity`] when
//! the evidence is strong enough, and the pairing says which of name or file
//! moved. Where the evidence is not strong enough they stay a separate removal
//! and addition, which is the honest description of "these might be the same
//! symbol and nothing here can tell".
