//! Evaluating [`crate::rules`] against a graph.
//!
//! The schema decides whether a rules file is well formed. This decides what
//! the rules say about a repository.
//!
//! # A rule has three outcomes, not two
//!
//! The obvious design gives a rule a boolean: it passed, or it did not. That
//! design is wrong here, and wrongly reassuring.
//!
//! A rule like "nothing under `core/` may import `cli/`" is a claim about
//! *absence*. To report it satisfied is to claim every edge out of `core/` was
//! examined and none pointed at `cli/`. Graphyn cannot always make that claim:
//! a [structural][crate::ir::Resolution::Structural] edge records that a call
//! to some `foo` happened, not which `foo` it reached. An unexamined edge
//! could be the violation. Reporting "satisfied" on that evidence is reporting
//! a pass the analysis has not earned — the one thing a deterministic gate
//! must never do.
//!
//! So a rule is [`Verdict::Satisfied`] only when every edge in its scope was
//! resolved. Where weaker edges could hide a violation the verdict is
//! [`Verdict::Inconclusive`], carrying the count of edges that prevented an
//! answer. Inconclusive is not a failure — it does not fail a gate — but it is
//! never silent either. It is the honest third answer, and the reason a Tier 2
//! language fails open rather than passing quietly.
//!
//! Violations, by contrast, are only ever reported on resolved evidence, so a
//! reported violation is a fact rather than a suspicion.
