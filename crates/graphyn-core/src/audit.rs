//! Detecting reward-hacking, deterministically.
//!
//! # What makes this different from the rest of the engine
//!
//! Every other finding here describes code. An audit finding describes
//! *conduct*: it says a change looks like it was made to pass a check rather
//! than to work. That is an accusation, and it will sometimes be levelled at a
//! person who did nothing wrong.
//!
//! Three consequences run through this module.
//!
//! **No detector may run on evidence it cannot stand behind.** Accusing
//! someone of tampering on the strength of a name matched inside one file is
//! worse than missing the tampering. Detectors see only symbols in files a
//! Tier 1 adapter resolved, and [`AuditContext::in_scope`] is how that is
//! enforced rather than remembered.
//!
//! **A finding must be identifiable across runs.** CI has to be able to say
//! "this is the finding you already looked at" without the developer
//! re-triaging it every push, so [`FindingId`] is derived from what the
//! finding is *about* and never from where it currently sits. A line number in
//! the id would make an unrelated edit upstream look like a new accusation.
//!
//! **A suppressed finding is reported as suppressed, never omitted.** The
//! whole point of this feature is that it cannot be quietly satisfied, and a
//! gate that silently drops what someone told it to ignore is exactly the
//! thing it exists to catch.
