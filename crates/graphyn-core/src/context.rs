//! A minimal working set for orienting an agent on a symbol.
//!
//! # What this is trading away
//!
//! An agent orienting itself on a symbol reads files. Reading `ir.rs` to learn
//! what `RepoIR` is costs the whole file, most of which is other types. This
//! emits the graph's answer instead: the symbol, what it depends on, what
//! depends on it, and a signature for each — the shape of the neighbourhood
//! rather than its contents.
//!
//! The trade is real and worth stating plainly. A signature tells you a
//! function exists and what it takes; it does not tell you what it does. This
//! is for the first question an agent asks — *what am I about to touch, and
//! what touches it* — and not a substitute for reading the code it is going to
//! change.
//!
//! # Why the token figure is an estimate
//!
//! Graphyn vendors no tokenizer and is not going to: a tokenizer is
//! model-specific, and a number that changed with somebody's model would not
//! be reproducible, which is the property everything here rests on. The
//! reported cost is a byte-based estimate, and it says so wherever it is
//! printed. It is honest about direction and magnitude, not about the exact
//! figure a given model would charge.
