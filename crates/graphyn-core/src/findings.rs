//! Turning a delta into judgements.
//!
//! [`crate::delta`] says what changed. This says what about the change is
//! worth someone's attention, and it is the layer every gate in the later
//! phases reads: a rule violation, an audit finding and a CI comment are all
//! phrased in terms of these.
//!
//! # Every finding carries its own confidence
//!
//! A finding derived entirely from structural edges is advisory, and one
//! derived from resolved edges is a fact. Mixing them into a single list with
//! no distinction is how a gate ends up blocking a change on a guess, so each
//! finding records the weakest resolution among the evidence that produced it
//! and callers filter on that rather than on the repository's average.
