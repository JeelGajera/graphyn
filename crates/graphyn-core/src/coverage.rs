//! How much of the graph a gate may act on.
//!
//! Every edge records how its target was determined — see [`Resolution`]. An
//! edge bound through the file's imports, aliases and declared types is a fact;
//! an edge matched by name inside one file is a guess that happens to be
//! useful. Both are in the graph, and until now nothing reported the ratio.
//!
//! That ratio is what makes an enforcing tool trustworthy. "No edges broken"
//! means something entirely different in a repository where 98% of references
//! resolved than in one where 40% did, and a gate that cannot tell the two
//! apart will eventually pass a change it should have stopped.
