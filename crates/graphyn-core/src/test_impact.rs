//! Which tests exercise a change.
//!
//! # Why this needs the same care as "safe to modify"
//!
//! Every other query here answers a question. This one licenses an *omission*:
//! a developer or an agent reads the answer and does not run the rest of the
//! suite. "These are the tests that cover your change" is therefore a claim
//! that the tests it leaves out cannot fail, and that claim is only as good as
//! the graph behind it.
//!
//! Graphyn's graph is knowingly incomplete in two ways that matter here. A
//! structural region records no cross-file references at all, so a test living
//! there could exercise the changed code without any edge to show for it. And
//! test detection is by file convention, so a test Graphyn did not recognise
//! as a test contributes nothing.
//!
//! So a [`TestSelection`] never says "run only these". It reports what it
//! found, and separately whether the selection is [complete enough to act
//! on][TestSelection::is_trustworthy]. A caller that ignores the second field
//! is making the omission claim on its own authority, not on Graphyn's.
