//! Per-edge resolution, and the verdict that rests on it.
//!
//! The claim `blast-radius` makes when it finds nothing — "safe to modify" —
//! is about the whole repository. It holds only if the whole graph was
//! resolved well enough to make it. Structural analysis cannot see across
//! files, so a reference living in a structural region would never have
//! reached the graph, and an empty result there is partly an artefact of how
//! much was resolved rather than a fact about the code.
//!
//! These cover the distinction itself and, more importantly, the two ways it
//! could quietly stop protecting anyone: the verdict forgetting to check, and
//! a mixed graph reporting itself as fully resolved.
