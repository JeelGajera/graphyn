//! Golden snapshots of the analysis over the whole fixture corpus.
//!
//! Graphyn's per-adapter tests each assert one property of one language. That
//! catches a regression someone thought to look for, and misses the kind that
//! matters most here: a refactor that quietly changes the graph everywhere.
//! The 1.0.0 plan opens with a large behaviour-preserving move of every
//! adapter into one crate, and "behaviour-preserving" is a claim, not a fact,
//! until the whole corpus is compared before and after.
//!
//! So these tests record the complete analysis of every fixture project and
//! diff it. A change to the goldens is not a failure — it is the diff you were
//! asked to review. What it must never be is invisible.
//!
//! Regenerate after an intended change, then read the diff before committing:
//!
//! ```bash
//! UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p graphyn-cli --test golden_ir
//! git diff crates/graphyn-cli/tests/golden
//! ```
