//! The safety verdict, as a user meets it.
//!
//! `blast-radius` finding nothing prints "safe to modify". That is a claim
//! about the whole repository, and it holds only if the whole graph was
//! resolved well enough to make it. A structural region cannot see across
//! files, so a reference living in one would never have reached the graph and
//! the emptiness is partly an artefact of how much was resolved.
//!
//! The interesting case is not that the warning appears, but that it appears
//! only when warranted: a false warning on a fully resolved repository would
//! train people to ignore it, which costs more than never having shipped it.
