//! `graphyn check` — enforce the rules a repository wrote down.
//!
//! The command a CI job runs. Everything about it is shaped by one
//! consequence: its exit status decides whether a change is allowed to land,
//! so an exit code it has not earned is worse than no gate at all.
//!
//! Three things follow from that.
//!
//! **A pass is stated, not implied.** Every rule is reported with its verdict,
//! including the ones that passed. A gate that prints nothing on success
//! teaches its readers that silence means "fine", and silence is also what a
//! misconfigured gate produces.
//!
//! **Undecided is not a pass.** A rule whose scope contains weakly resolved
//! edges is reported as undecided and does not fail the build. That is the
//! fail-open half of the contract — a Tier 2 language must not block a merge
//! on evidence it cannot stand behind — but it is printed every time, because
//! a fail-open that nobody sees is indistinguishable from a pass.
//!
//! **Only violations set a failing status**, and only at `error` severity.
//! Exit 1 means a rule was broken on resolved evidence. Exit 2 means the check
//! could not run — an unreadable rules file, no graph, a missing snapshot —
//! and is deliberately distinct, so a pipeline can tell "your change is bad"
//! from "this tool is misconfigured" rather than reading both as a veto.
