//! Markdown rendering for `diff` and `check`.
//!
//! This is the format most people will ever see Graphyn in: a comment on a
//! pull request, read once, in a hurry, by someone deciding whether to click
//! merge. It is a product surface, not a serialisation of internal state.
//!
//! Three rules follow from who reads it.
//!
//! **The verdict is the first line.** A reader who stops after one line must
//! still have the answer. Everything below it is evidence for a decision
//! already stated.
//!
//! **Findings before counts.** A broken reference is what the reader came for.
//! "14 symbols added" is not, and putting it first buries the finding under
//! arithmetic.
//!
//! **Uncertainty is never omitted for tidiness.** A rule that could not be
//! decided, or a diff with no gate-safe evidence in it, says so in the comment
//! rather than only in the exit status. The comment is what gets read.
