//! `graphyn tests` — which tests exercise a change.
//!
//! The verify loop. An agent today either runs the whole suite, which is slow
//! enough that it skips it, or runs nothing, which is unsafe. This makes the
//! middle option cheap enough to actually take.
//!
//! What makes that dangerous, and what this command is built around: the
//! answer licenses an *omission*. Naming the tests that cover a change is a
//! claim that the ones left out cannot fail, and Graphyn's graph is knowingly
//! incomplete — structural regions record no cross-file references, and test
//! detection is by file convention.
//!
//! So the selection and the confidence in it are reported as two separate
//! things, and the exit status carries the second. A caller that runs only
//! these tests after a non-zero status is making the omission claim on its own
//! authority.
