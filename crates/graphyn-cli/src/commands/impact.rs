//! `graphyn impact` — what depends on one file.
//!
//! Built for a hook rather than a person. A hook fires before an agent writes
//! to a file and knows only the path: there is no symbol to ask about yet, so
//! `query blast-radius` cannot answer, and guessing a symbol from the filename
//! would answer a different question confidently.
//!
//! Two properties matter more here than anywhere else in the CLI.
//!
//! **It must not fail on an unremarkable input.** A path outside the graph — a
//! new file, a language no adapter handles, a file the analysis excluded — is
//! reported as "no dependents recorded" rather than an error. A hook that
//! errors the first time an agent touches a README is a hook that gets removed
//! from the settings file that afternoon.
//!
//! **It must not overstate.** An empty answer is qualified by whether the
//! graph could have seen a dependent at all: structural regions cannot record
//! a cross-file reference, so "nothing depends on this" from such a graph is a
//! statement about what was resolved, not about the code.
