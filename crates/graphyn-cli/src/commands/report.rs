//! `graphyn report` — one markdown report for a pull request.
//!
//! The Action posts exactly one comment, so exactly one command produces it.
//! Concatenating `diff` and `check` output would give the reader two headings,
//! two verdicts and no statement of which one decides the merge.
//!
//! Exit status matches `check`, because the same thing is being decided:
//! 0 when nothing was violated, 1 when a rule was broken on resolved evidence,
//! 2 when the report could not be produced at all. A CI job reads the status;
//! a person reads the comment; neither should have to consult the other to
//! find out what happened.
