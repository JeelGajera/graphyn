//! The machine-readable shape of an analysis.
//!
//! Graphyn's output is consumed by agents, hooks and CI as much as by people,
//! and prose is a poor contract for any of them. This module defines that
//! contract explicitly rather than letting it emerge from whatever `RepoIR`
//! happens to derive.
//!
//! Two properties matter and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! **It is versioned.** A consumer that pins `schema_version` can tell a shape
//! it understands from one it does not, instead of failing on a missing field
//! at the point of use. The version is here from the first release that emits
//! JSON at all, because retrofitting one means every existing consumer has to
//! handle its absence.
//!
//! **It is deterministic.** Identical input produces byte-identical output.
//! That is Graphyn's defining property, and it only holds end to end if every
//! collection on the way out has a stable ordering key — see
//! [`graphyn_core::ir::RepoIR::language_stats`] for the case that did not.
