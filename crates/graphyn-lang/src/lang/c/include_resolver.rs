//! Resolving `#include` directives and the type names they bring into scope.
//!
//! Two bugs lived here. Includes resolved to `local_header::<name>`, a string
//! that is neither a symbol id nor an `ext::` package, so
//! [`graphyn_core::graph::GraphynGraph::add_relationship`] dropped every one of
//! them — a C repository produced a graph with zero edges. And type names were
//! looked up in a repository-wide, first-wins map, so a `typedef struct Foo Bar`
//! bound to whichever `Foo` happened to be indexed first regardless of what the
//! file could actually see.
//!
//! Includes now resolve to the header's module symbol, and a type name is only
//! visible if the file defines it or includes a header that does — which is
//! what the C compiler does too.
