//! Java — the first Tier 2 language.
//!
//! Deliberately the whole module. There is no parser, no extractor and no
//! resolver here, because a Tier 2 language needs none: analysis runs through
//! [`crate::structural`], driven by the `tags.scm` the grammar already ships.
//!
//! This is the demonstration that adding a language is a dependency, a feature
//! flag and a spec. What it is *not* is a claim that Graphyn understands Java
//! the way it understands the Tier 1 languages: nothing here resolves an
//! import, follows an alias, or binds a declared type, and `graphyn status`
//! says so.
//!
//! Promoting Java to Tier 1 means implementing import resolution, alias
//! resolution and declared-type binding for it. That is weeks of work and is
//! explicitly out of scope for 1.0.0.
